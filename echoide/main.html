        Some say that global elites want to replace us with perfect replicas.
        <br>

        <span style="font-size:10px;">"Echoides" is a species of sorts that I came up with. Feel free to expand upon the idea as you wish, but keep in mind it is *your* interpretation and it isn't automatically canon.<br>
        It's sort of a humane answer to the AI garbage stories that are getting wildly popular, where humans aren't outlawed and entirely replaced by bullshit like ChatGPT or other LLMs.</span>
