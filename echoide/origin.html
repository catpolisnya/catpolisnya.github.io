        <h2>First Data Research</h2>
        Scientists from around the world have been working for decades to be able to backup a human being's brain data onto a portable physical storage for preservation and possible further use.
<br><br>
        Due to massive funding and collaboration between various universities, it has been possible to develop a proprietary storage device, visually reminding of a CD disc. 
        The CD disc was capable of storing full brain images of an average adult human; from basic functions to memories, personality traits, skills and so on.
        <br><br>
        Its initial purpose was to preserve people's sentiences after their death at the request of their loved ones or the deceased themselves. Some creators believed that as the research will progress, people will be able to restore their relatives by uploading said data to the internet, acting as digital personal assistances or via other means.
        <br><br>
        This however was abandoned for a while, and companies along with scientists have been instead pursuing a much better and profitable goal: they instead wanted to preserve all of human knowledge in this world.
        <br><br>
        Over the years, they were collecting samples from both (consenting) deceased test subject, living people and other sources, building up an enormous library of knowledge, spanning from the idea of how the human body performed its basic functions like breathing, walking, the heartbeat and so on; through the information on how a brain acquires new information, learns new skills, forms a personality and likes/dislikes of things; to complex topics and knowledge of various aspects of life, science, arts, society and many more things.
        <br><br>
        Thus, this marked the creation of <b>Life Library</b>, which had many checkpoints around the world in every continent; connected by underground tunnels in which people could move between the checkpoints safely to access what they need.
    <h2>Creation Of A Man</h2>
    <h3>First Layer</h3>
    A different team of bioscientists, along with biologists and robotics engineers have been working on a device that would make use of the disc data. Initially, the machine looked nothing like a human, with its main purpose being Machine Learning and further advancements in certain science fields, where humans could not advance. 
    <br><br>
However, at that time humanity as a whole, around the world has been dealing with decreasing population due to the outcome of wars, conflicts, migrations, illnesses and other events that impacted our life.  
Thus the prototyping geared towards more anthropomorphic appearance of the robot.
<br><br>
With the help of previous research on growing human organs and skin cells, the team has engineered a kind of hardware set that was capable of mimicking the human brain structures. Unlike most machinery utilizing a "brain", this one had caps similar to a natural human brain, making it more realistic and as a prevention of robot apocalypse. This has spanned into creating the prototypes of the entire organ system that was resistant to heat, cold, humidity; just like natural organs of a human being.
<br><br>
Thus it was possible to build the first layer of a droid, consisting of many connections from and to the brain, and with several organs. While it was not a 1:1 copy of a human being, it was similar enough where human doctors familiar with their anatomy could perform most surgeries on a droid after additional training.  
This also marks an important addition that was the disc tray, placed on the chest area, shielding out the droid's heart and lungs. 
<br><br>
After months of testing, it was possible to use a disc to install first data on the droid. However, at that stage it was unusable due to lacking a lot in its building, and that its appearance in current state would not appeal to the wider public.
    <h3>Second Layer</h3>
    In order to make installation and further set-up easier, it was decided that the droid will be covered by a material specifically engineered and designed for them. Its construction seemed quite paradoxical, as it was both metallic and sturdy, but also stretchy and squishy like muscles. Appended to that were joint protectors and a giant screen in the place of face.
    <br><br>
This was known as "maintenance mode", as it was now much easier to install data and be able to track progress, as well as check the system's health without the need to hook the droid up to special machinery.
   <h3>Third Layer</h3>
   The maintenance layer was still unappealing to the public, therefore it was time for the final stage of development.
   <br><br>
   Once again, using previous research on skin cells, the team was able to recreate the structure on a droid, along with the idea of how it healed scars, cuts, bruises and other types of damage. Engineers on the other hand, were prototyping eye-like devices that would connect to the brain and mimic the behavior of human eyes.
   <br><br>
   After months of development, the prototype droid looked nearly identical to the final product - lacking things like hair on head, nipples, belly button and genitals.
   <br><br>
   In order to give life to the droid, it was installed with the basic brain data during maintenance mode, essentially making it akin to a human newborn. Due to the advancements along with the Life Library, it was possible to later on install additional data on it like a pre-made personality, skills, hobbies and so on.
   <br><br>
   However, it came with a risk: while organic skill acquisition was not damaging the brain structures and in fact was the preferred way of teaching a droid; installing data from the disk could result in corruption of brain sectors, which could render the droid unusable, or dead.
   <br><br>
   Despite that, from-disc skill acquisition was commonly used, therefore droids have become recognizable by a characteristic scar on their chest, where the disc tray was hidden.
   <br><br>
   Months later, a first complete droid was shown off to the public. It was indistinguishable from a natural human being in its build, behavior and socialization. This would open new doors to humanity; and while at the time there were fears of a robot apocalypse, along with some fascist tendencies and conspiracy theories that humans are replaced with robots by the global elites; the adoption was widespread and years after debuting; droids were full members of society just like humans, even with legislation around the world adapting to the new circumstances.
