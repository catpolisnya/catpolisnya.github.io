<b>Inclusivity, please!</b><br>
Migrations are bound to happen. People change their places of residence all the time for various reasons; family, fleeing from war and persecution, better economic perspectives and 
many more.<br>
Governments around the world expect the newcomers to integrate with the local communities; which, you know, is fine by me. The point in my view is not to abandon your roots at all, but even as a curiosity it is good to know about
the local lifestyles.<br><br>
One of the major areas of social integration is language. Most of the time, migration or fleeing means you are entering a space with people that speak different language than you. 
It is only natural to have an expectation that you two can communicate with each other.

<br>
But what do the governments do to help this issue?<br><br>
Some of them implement special programs to help newcomers learn the host's language, which is good.
But not enough.
<br><br>
Integration needs to happen on a more widespread scale. It needs to be integrated in daily lives of people.
<br><br>
Lately, a major <a href="https://aussiedlerbote.de/en/the-future-broadcasts-of-tagesschau-will-be-presented-in-simpler-terms/">German news program</a> has decided to broadcast in simpler language;
it is mainly targetted towards those who are learning German or want news to be more straight-to-the-point.<br>
Which is good! <br>
This is something not only learners and busy people can benefit from, but also people with various disabilities that have problems comprehending complex languages.

<br><br>

Countrymen of all states unite - here is my (and I hope yours too) plea for a more integrated society:
<br>
<b>We want governments and broadcasters to join arms and push for more simplified news broadcasts.</b>
<br><br>
Not only that, but also <b>dedicated media in simplified language</b> in all daily life areas - tailored to people's language abilities and potential obstacles in understanding the broadcast.
<br><br>
Osmosis and daily interaction with local culture and its speech is a way for an united society. If we adjust these to a newcomer's level, only then you can toot your horns about integrating people.
<br><br>
Let's make life easier. Not only for those who learn the language.
<br>
Do it for the disabled.
<br>
Do it for the busy.
<br>
Do it for everyone. It will benefit us all in the end.
<br>
<b>And let's not shame those new to a language over mistakes.</b>
