            <hr>
           Hi! You may know me under the nicknames <b>Rangaku</b> or <b>Haas(yuu)</b> online. I am just a random <b>20-something</b> guy living somewhere in <b>Europe</b> trying to grasp his life together.
           <br><br>
           I have been a part of the internet since around <b>2008-09</b> and have decided to live here since then. Nonetheless, I started webweaving just in <b>2021</b>, because before that I thought HTML and CSS were too hard (they're not, learn these NOW!)<br><br>
           I usually do <b>digital art</b>, in particular things to do with pretty men and love between men. And yes, I'm <b>gay</b>, if that wasn't already obvious.  :3<br><br>
           I can sort of communicate in <b>English</b> and <b>Dutch</b> - other languages are irrelevant. Also, I can read some <b>kana</b>. Try your luck in communication!
           <br><br>
           I wouldn't call myself a <b>furry</b> despite having an anthropomorphic animal sona. I simply dislike the fandom as a whole because of its toxicity and <b>classism</b>. Individual
           peeps are super cool though.<br><br>
I currently own a <b>Nintendo Wii</b> and an <b>old Nintendo 3DS</b>. Both modded, of course.<br><br>
<b>Things you may find interesting:</b>
<ul>
    <li>I love cats a lot. I have an orange boy at home.</li>
    <li>I suck at Pokémon despite being into the series since forever.</li>
    <li>My first game ever was <b>Super Mario Sunshine</b>.</li>
    <li>My current art workstation consists of <b>XP-Pen Artist 12</b> and a junk laptop.</li>
    <li>I own way too many <b>domains</b>.</li>
</ul>
