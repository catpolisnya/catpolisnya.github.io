<p>Hi, I'm <b>Alexander</b>. Or just Alex.</p>
<p>I'm a 2X year old guy who is haunting the <b title="The Netherlands!">Lands of Nether</b> with my scary queer and immigrant presence. Perhaps if that already turns you off, too bad. This isn't a place for you.</p>
<p>During the daytime I usually do <b>digital art</b>, which as of now is my main source of income. In my free time I also maintain an <b>Akkoma</b> server,
as well as partially take care of a small, friend-only digital community I commonly refer to as <b>Demae</b> in honor of the first Fediverse instance we had, called Demae Party.</p>

<p>Friends like to say I'm experimental with regards to my work... I guess they are right, I always love to jump between styles when drawing, trying to mix and match things.</p>

<p>I've been dealing with the (de)buff of being <b>autistic</b> and being a long-term <b title="domestic violence">DV</b> survivor. It kind of shaped my perspective on things, you know?</p>

<p>I am a big fan of <b>Pok√©mon</b> series (in terms of games rather than anime though...) and I've started collecting cards into my album.
Other things I do? I have way too much <b title="Miffy, if you are outside of NL">Nijntje</b> products. And plushies.</p>

<p>I am somewhere between a normie and a furry. I don't involve myself with the community because it's been abusive plenty of times but I like funny animals.
    I rather consider myself otherkin.
</p>

<p>I do not have the tech smarts, but I like old computers from an <b>aesthetic</b> standpoint. <br>I also kind of hoard tech.
I currently own a <b>New Nintendo 2DS XL</b>, a <b>2011 Macbook Pro</b>, a <b>Lenovo Thinkpad T61</b>, an <b>iPhone 6S</b>, an <b>iPhone SE 2020</b>,a <b>Blackberry Curve 9320</b> and a jank HP laptop I use as my main workstation along with <b>XP Pen Artist 12</b></p>
