<h3>The story of Van Buren Shrine</h3>

<p>The origins of the shrine are unknown. It is said to exist
    only in the mind of one who is delusional and seeks refuge from the horrors of the real life by 
    escaping into a fictional realm of being cared about and protected.
</p>

<p>To some, however, it is a very real place; as it can be willed into existence by anyone no matter who or where they are; be it
    in the digital space or a physical point on a world map. 
</p>

<p>Its name comes from a pseudonymous alias of the protector to whom the shrine is dedicated. However, his name is never spoken out loud for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>Some theories claim that saying the full name brings discomfort to those who seek protection. Others say that it is a principle of don't ask-don't tell.</p>

<p>Do not be mistaken, as there is a common misconception that he is some sort of a deity. It comes from how people commonly see shrines as a place of worship, and not a place of safety and peace.</p>

<p>There is a tale that states that once upon a time a young woman in a maid's dress has approached the shrine and ended her life there as a last resort. It was never revealed why she did it; but unlike other souls that left
    on their own, hers never came back to make life harder for anyone, as a token of appreciation that she was able to leave safely.
</p>
<p>If one seeks refuge in the shrine for whatever reason, it is in good faith to provide additional comfort, no matter how absurd it may seem to a bystander.</p>

<p>If you see a Van Buren's Shrine anywhere, you are safe.</p>
