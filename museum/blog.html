    <h3>27/07/2024 - We need your help!</h3>
Welcome to IDHM!<br>
We are starting a new project, aimed to record important things that once reigned in the cyberspace, but now are gone, obscure or simply not as popular as it used to be.<br><br>
But it is only one body that is maintaining the museum, and we need your hands on board!<br><br>
Due to the mission of IDHM, which is to record internet history and pay attention to things that were popular outside of the digital Anglosphere, we cannot singlehandedly scout every piece that exists out there. <br>
<b>How to help?</b>
<br><br>
Please mail us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@hofnarretje.eu">this e-mail address</a> with all the pieces of media that were/are significant to the internet culture.<br><br>
We especially ask for contributions from non-Anglosphere spaces in order to avoid dominance in our expositions. Be it an animated webseries, a website, a video game, a further unspecified phenomenon or what-you-got, we will be thankful.<br><br>

<b>We also encourage you to mail us if you see any bugs to be squashed on the website or have any feedback. E-mail is the only valid way to reach us and we will not answer to inquiries outside of this medium.</b>
