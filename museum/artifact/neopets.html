<div class="textboxmain"><h2>Kacheek - Neopets</h2>
Neopets is probably one of the most known virtual pet sites, starting in 1999.<br>
The premise is simple: People could register on the sites and take care of the pets, dressing them up, feeding them or even send them into battles.<br>
Given its popularity, it has logged 1 trillion pageviews in 2011 since its dawn.
<br><br>
Neopets has fallen from popularity around 2015, falling into obscurity. Years later, in 2021, Neopets were one of the victims of the metaverse/NFT treatment, but due to its dedicated fanbase's opposition, it was cancelled in 2023.
