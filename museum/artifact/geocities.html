<div class="textboxmain"><h2>GeoCities</h2>
Geocities is something probably most of people remember, especially if they are more than 20.<br>
It was a web hosting service launched in 1994 that allowed users to, well, host their websites for free.<br><br>
The gimmick of GeoCities was that it had something called "cities", which were basically thematic categories that sorted all sites hosted on GC.

<br>
GeoCities has spawned whole generations of webmasters, designers, coders and other flavors of webweavers that are likely to work now in the industry; and its impact
on the early internet culture cannot be properly described.<br>
It was bought out by Yahoo in 1999, and like with most things bought out by corporate giants, it only spelled end for GeoCities. But not that soon.<br><br>
GeoCities continued to grow.<br><br>
Until 2009, where the US version of GeoCities has closed its doors.<br>
The Japanese rendition of GeoCities continued to exist for 10 more years, finally marking the end of a very important era in the internet history in 2019.
<br><br>
<hr><br>
<b>Status</b><br>With the downfall of hobbyist webhosting in place of social networking sites, it was plain clear that GeoCities had to die.<br>
However, <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> is a spiritual indie successor to GeoCities that hosts many websites.
