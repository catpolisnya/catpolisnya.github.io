The western world had ICQ, AIM, MSN Messenger and other fancy things.<br>
Poland had Gadu-Gadu.<br><br>
Released in 2000, it was a simple IM like many others where you exchanged GG numbers with others to talk.
<br>
With the popularity of internet in Poland and advantages over SMS messaging, it became the number one platform in the country, gathering 6.5 million users online and over 10 million registered accounts.
<br><br>
Like with many other fun things, it has been killed by Facebook and its bundled Messenger. While it still exists, it's a very obscure piece of history.
<br><br>
<hr><br>
<b>Status</b><br>It still exists, but it is a hollow shell where you only can find weirdos or pedophiles.
