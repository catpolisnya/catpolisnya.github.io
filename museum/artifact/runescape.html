Launching in 2001, RuneScape is an MMORPG set in a medieval fantasy world. As with many of those, you could level up your character, interact with others, do quests and minigames.<br><br>
Most notable of RuneScape is its Grand Exchange, serving essentially as a market for all items with a somewhat advanced economy that makes you feel like being on an actual stock market.<br>
<br>
Runescape has went through several changes, most notably from RuneScape Classic, to "07Scape" (which is now reinstated as OldSchool Runescape), and later on a new version, dubbed "Runescape 3" being released in 2013.<br><br>
Despite being alive, RuneScape deserves its mention in the Museum for notably dedicated community, which can be easily proven by the popularity of OldSchool Runescape compared to RS3
