<div class="textboxmain"><h2>Hyves</h2>
Before Facebook's monopolist reign, there were many other social networking sites around the world. Hyves is one of them.<br><br>
Operating in the Netherlands, it obviously amassed a giant Dutch userbase, despite being available also in English.<br>
Since opening in 2004, it has gathered over 10 million users (including alt and inactive accounts).<br>
<br>
It has closed its doors in 2013.

<b>Status</b><br>Hyves itself is non-existent. The only remaining thing is Hyves Games, where you can use your Hyves account to play games.
