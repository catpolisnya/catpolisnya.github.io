<div class="textboxmain"><h2>Pan Gąbka - Nasza Klasa</h2>
In the era of local social networking sites, the number one website in Poland was Nasza-Klasa that launched in 2006.<br>
Initially starting as a website to find your own classmates, it soon evolved into a national monopoly for everyone. One of the features was an explicit allowance of "fictional accounts" - something Facebook
despises because it poisons their data harvesting empire.
<br>
Its most popular feature was an on-site currency called "eurogąbki" (eurosponges) that could be used for profile gifts or buying various in-game currencies.
<br><br>
NK has fallen out of use around 2014, and finally closing their doors in 2021.
