<div class="textboxmain"><h2>Hypercam 2</h2>
In the old days of YouTube, it was unheard of to use OBS for recording, and if any editing existed, it was usually done with Windows Movie Maker.
<br>
Due to its low level of entry and being free, Hypercam 2 was used by people to record their epic Club Penguin tutorials or Runescape gameplays. 
<br><br>
It was mostly recognizable because of its watermark in the top left corner, despite the fact you could simply pay once to get rid of it.

<b>Status</b><br>While everyone moved away from using HC2 for recording, you can still download a copy on Internet Archive!
