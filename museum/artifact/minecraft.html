Despite its popularity to this day, Minecraft has its place in the museum. Why?<br><br>
This is a place of rememberance to older days of Minecraft, when it had its initial wave of popularity on the internet,
when it was still a sandbox game rather than a wannabe RPG game. It was focused on doing whatever you wanted and using your creativity, rather than having several set goals and a lore.
<br>
The community used to be way different than it is now.

<b>Status</b><br>Thankfully, you can still play old versions of Minecraft with pretty much any popular launcher.
