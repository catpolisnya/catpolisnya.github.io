<div class="textboxmain"><h2>Fella - deviantArt</h2>
A somewhat obscure piece of history, Fella used to be a mascot of the deviantArt website.
<br><br>
<b>deviantArt</b> used to be a website filled with creatives of all levels - from beginners to professionals in the industry.
<br>Despite its somewhat weird reputation in the following years, it was a cornerstone of many communities and fandoms, giving a kickstart to many people in their art career.
<br><br>
<hr><br>
<b>Status</b><br>Although the site exists, it is only a husk of its former self, going through a corporate 
design change that many people disliked and nowadays embracing generative AI garbage that litters the front page
that once used to be home for up and coming actual talents.
