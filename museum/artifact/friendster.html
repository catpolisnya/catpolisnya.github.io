<div class="textboxmain"><h2>Friendster</h2>
Friendster is one of the few social networking sites that predates giants like mySpace, Facebook and many others. <br>
It was launched in 2003 and in just a span of months, it has gathered 3 million users within few months of its existence.
<br>
Friendster was mostly used in Southeast Asia, most particularly in the Philippines and Indonesia.
<br>
Despite over 115 million users in Asia in 2008, it started to lose popularity. Friendster has relaunched as a social gaming site in 2011.<br>
<br>
And despite the efforts, it shut its doors in 2015.

<b>Status</b><br>Friendster is dead, but there is an unofficial attempt at remaking it, but there is no information about it.
