<div class="textboxmain"><h2>Adobe Flash</h2>
Earlier known as Macromedia Flash before it was bought out by Adobe, this was a... thing. A main cornerstone of the internet in early 2000s, it was used as software for not only animation, but also game development and webmastery, allowing users for creative expression.<br>
Countless sites and games used Flash and ActionScript, allowing for the idea of browser games to fully bloom and develop.
<br><br>
Due to its constant vulnerabilities however, and the development of newer webdev technology, Flash has fallen out of use and Adobe ended its support in 2020.<br>
Removal of ability to play Flash content in web browsers in 2021 was the final nail in the coffin, some describing it as one of most important (and saddest) ends of an era in the history of internet.
